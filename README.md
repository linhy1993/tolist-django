The link of [book](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/praise.harry.html), followed tdd develop process.
Can deploy on AWS and other web services.

It is a to-do list, can add items and share with other people. Support sign in with sending email. 
All the tests can be run in test folder.

It is a really good book to introduce TDD, I think I will re-read it again after I learn more about Django.
